Ansible role to install websvn

Maybe you want to expand the template for using it.

WebSVN is ugly. be carefully and think twice before using it!

---------------------------------

BACKGROUND:

This role installs a websvn. Since I personally find this whole svn very suspicious, the role has not received much love. But since websvn was explicitly requested, an ansible role was needed that installs websvn.

The role was tested on a Debian Buster server. The https://subversion.apache.org/ with the https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-svn role was also installed on this server. Together with the https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php role.

If you like, pull-requests are always welcome!
